## Primary Research Area
1. **3D positioning including compensation by mobile interrogator (rather than fixed anchor)**  
   1. Usage : position measuring by Drones
   1. Consideration : position of z-axis 
1. **Utilization of UWB enabled chip in smart phone**
   1. Consideration : similarity of beacon and bluetooth
1. **Indoor and outdoor positioning integration**
   1. Consideration : GPS battery consumption / communication protocols including switching on the border
1. **Replacement of other IEEE 802.15.4 devices in terms of security**
1. **IR (Impulse Radio) Emission into WBAN (Wireless Body Area Network)**
   1. Usage : GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar)  
   
## Related Topics 
- Tools : Machine Learning / Blockchain / Edge Computing  
- Further Research : LoRaWan / NB-IoT   
- Consideration
  1. UWB chip manufacturers mostly provide with positioning algorithms and software, so that a pivotal direction is critical, whether it is for the algorithm itself, for the combination of existing algorithms, or for the application development.   
  1. The prices of the chip and AP's will go down as many manufacturers are producing, so that the potential revenue should be kept in mind.
