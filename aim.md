# Aim at 

## Primary Research Area
1. **3D positioning including compensation by mobile interrogator (rather than fixed anchor)**  
   1. Usage : position measuring by Drones
   1. Consideration : position of z-axis 
1. **Utilization of UWB enabled chip in smart phone**
   1. Consideration : similarity of beacon and bluetooth
1. **Seamless indoor and outdoor positioning integration**
   1. Consideration : GPS battery consumption / communication protocols including switching on the border
1. **Reinforcement of securiy in short range wireless communication, based on IEEE 802.15.4z using UWB**

## Secondary Research Area and Business Opportunity 
1. **IR (Impulse Radio) Emission into WBAN (Wireless Body Area Network)**
   1. Usage : GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar)  
1. **Latency reduction in distance measurement and real-time tracking (monitoring)**
1. **Monitoring and managment of RTLS & IPS on smart phone**

- Consideration
  1. UWB chip manufacturers mostly provide with positioning algorithms and software, so that a pivotal direction is critical, whether it is for the algorithm itself, for the combination of existing algorithms, or for the application development.   
  1. The prices of the chip and AP's will go down as many manufacturers are producing, so that the potential revenue should be kept in mind.
